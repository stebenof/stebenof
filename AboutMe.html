 <h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>Hello, and welcome to my first website! I have created this as part of my CTI 110 course. To be submitted on 5/14/2025</p>
 <p>This final project brings together what has been learned over the semester. It was also my first true class surrounding programming, so it was fun to learn!</p>
 <p>I look forward to coming back to this website at the end of my program to see the growth and knowledge gained</p>
